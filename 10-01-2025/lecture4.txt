Access Modifiers (img : access modifiers)
______________________
1. Default - Available in package
2. Public - Available to everyone
3. Protected	- Visible within same package or it's subclass
4. Private	- Only visible to class itself

* Outer class can only have Public and Default as access modifiers
* Inner class can have Private, Public and Protected
* Default scope is available only within the package
* There no default keyword as access modifier. It's just a terminology.

* How to create package in java?
-> code (packages.java)
   compile with " -d . " to create custom package

* import statement can only import the package itself and not it's sub-packages.

* Protected methods and variables cannot be accessed by subclasses using instance variables of parent class, rather they can be called directly. (clone method of object class).

** Always check the class scope before members
